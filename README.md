Using the Firefox browser and the Selenium library, 
a bot application that logs into the entered Instagram page, 
checks the followers and the followed accounts, 
and identifies the accounts that you follow but do not follow you back, 
then displays them on an interface created with PyQt5.

Please enter your username and password into the appropriate places inside the user.py file, 
then run the application through the follow.py file.

If your internet is slow, you may encounter errors in the code due to internet latency. 
In this case, 
you can input larger values into the time.sleep() method to slow down the operation of the bot.
